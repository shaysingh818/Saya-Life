DB STRUCTURE

STATE --> COUNTY --> Get lot tiers for county --> Get HCF tiers for county --> determine tier usage --> get county service charges --> create county bill 

1.) Create a water tier rate system that can take COUNTY and STATE/User profile HCF as input and generate service charges, tier rates and lot sizes
		
		If I want to get all the county lot size ranges:
			lotsize = LotSize.objects.all(filter by county)
			for lot in lotsize: 
				ranges = range(lot.lot_size_low, lot.lot_size_high) 
				
			for lot in lotsize:  
		        if 7501 in range(lot.lot_size_low, lot.lot_size_high): 
    			         print(lot) 


2.) Backend portal
	Need to be able to add Lot Sizes and Tier ranges for COUNTY
	View all charges that apply to a county
	
3.) Mobile user interface(DO THIS when the BACKEND side is down)
	Create a user interface that will show charges



ENDPOINTS: 
	Create endpoint for adding all 50 States to the API
	Create endpoints for adding counties under STATES
